We are creating an IOT based argiculture system that can monitor the soil moisture and use this device to automate the irrigation process through phone while we are busy with work.
Materials required: 
Mini Arduino,
soil moisture sensor,
Bluetooth Hc 05- for frontend app communication,
1 relay module- 2 channel DPDT Relay,
solenoid valve,
pipe or hose for irrigation (hasn't been implemented through our project),
wires for connection.
We created an app layout that can be used to detect the moisture in the soil when we inserted the sensor in dry and wet soil and to display message to turn ON and turn OFF the pump accordingly.
