We are creating an IOT based argiculture system that can monitor he soil moisture and use this device to automate the irrigation process through phone while we are busy with work.
Materials required: 
Mini Arduino,
soil moisture sensor,
Bluetooth Hc 05- for frontend app communication,
1 relay module- 2 channel DPDT Relay,
solenoid valve,
pipe and hose for irrigation (hasn't been implemented through our project),
wires for connection.
